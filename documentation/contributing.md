## Building Modules
Kit is early in development, and consequentially, it's module index remains scarce. The foremost task going forward is to populate this index with a variety of utilities. That way, developers need not re-implement code unnecessarily. Instead, they can include hash tables, dynamic arrays, and more complex tools with one include statement.

If you find yourself reusing a module that you've built, it may be useful to others as well. In such cases, feel free to send in a pull request with your module included in `MODULES.csv`. It would be greatly appreciated.

Another need is the wrapping of common libraries. In a few minutes, existing C projects can be forked, modified to meet the Kit standard, and linked to in `MODULES.csv`. 



## Developing Core
At this point, there is no clear roadmap for future feature additions (I suppose writing said roadmap is the first step). That said, everyone's welcome to fork this repository, make arbitrary changes, and send a pull request.
