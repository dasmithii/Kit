Not ready for primetime, but it's getting there.



## Overview
In contrast with more modern languages, C has no central authority in terms of project management. From directory structure to build tools and package management, everything seems fragmented. More so, libraries are inaccessibly scattered across the web - and that encourages developers to reinvent the wheel over and over again.

Kit is my personal solution to these problems. It provides standardized project structure, centralized module indexing, and a convenient build tool.


## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/dasmithii/Kit.git
