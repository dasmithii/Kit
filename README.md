## Status
Not ready for primetime, but it's getting there.



## Overview
In contrast with many modern languages, C has no central authority of project management. From basic directory structure to build tools, everything seems fragmented. More so, libraries are inaccessibly scattered across the web - and that pressures developers to reinvent the wheel over and over again.

Kit is a solution to these problems. It provides standardized project structure, centralized module indexing, and a convenient build tool.


## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/dasmithii/Kit.git
cd Kit
python setup.py install
cd ..
```
